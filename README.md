# APIForge - Frontend ⚡️

**APIForge** is a developer-first platform designed to decouple frontend development from backend dependencies. It allows frontend teams to create instant **Mock APIs**, simulate network conditions (latency, errors), and test endpoints using a robust, built-in HTTP client.

Stop waiting for the backend. Forge your own APIs instantly.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡️ Instant Mock Servers:** Create RESTful endpoints in seconds by simply pasting JSON.
* **🐢 Latency Simulation:** Artificially inject network delays (e.g., 2000ms) to test loading states and skeletons.
* **💥 Chaos Engineering:** Randomly fail requests (e.g., 10% chance of 500 Error) to test error boundaries and resilience.
* **📮 Request Hub:** A full-featured HTTP client (like Postman) to test your mocks and real APIs.
* **↔️ Resizable, Persisted Layout:** Drag to resize the sidebar and the request/response split — like a real IDE, not a fixed 60/40 layout. Your layout is remembered between sessions, and the response console can be collapsed/expanded with one click.
* **🗂️ Multi-Tab Workspace:** Open several requests, mocks, and environments at once in a browser-style tab strip — closable, pinnable, and restored on refresh.
* **🌍 Environment Variables:** Switch between Local, Dev, and Prod contexts using dynamic variables like `{{baseUrl}}`.
* **📊 Real-time Analytics:** Track request history, status codes, and response times in a unified dashboard.
* **🛡️ Secure Authentication:** JWT-based auth with Next.js Middleware protection and cold-start handling.
